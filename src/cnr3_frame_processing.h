/*
    CNR3 frame-processing boundary.

    The settled algorithmic boundary is:

        output[N] depends on source[N] and previous filtered output[N-1].

    The predecessor is the previous filtered OUTPUT frame, not source[N-1].
    That distinction is essential to CNR2/CNR3 recursive temporal behaviour and
    must not be weakened as pixel implementation grows.

    CMS07-P.3A introduces the scalar weighted chroma blend helper. It
    reproduces the definitional vsCnr2 blend arithmetic exactly while preserving
    the deliberate P.2A native parameter-scaling rule: bit-exact CNR2 blend
    arithmetic and response-curve construction, with proportional round-to-nearest
    parameter scaling that is identical to CNR2 at 8-bit and 16-bit and corrects
    CNR2's integer-factor truncation at 10/12/14-bit.

    CMS07-P.4A introduces only the scalar downsampled-luma tap coordinate and
    four-tap average helpers. They reproduce vsCnr2's downSampleLuma shape:
    x0 = chroma_x << subSamplingW, x1 = x0 + 1, y0 = chroma_y << subSamplingH,
    y1 = y0 + subSamplingH, and (a + b + c + d + 2) >> 2. Right/bottom edge
    reads are clamped deliberately so CNR3 does not rely on frame-padding slack.

    Accuracy upgrades are permitted only where vsCnr2 is accidentally lossy.
    Definitional integer arithmetic is reproduced bit-exactly. P.3A therefore
    keeps shift2 = depth << 1, shift = 1LL << shift2, shift1 = shift >> 1, and
    the int64 accumulator form exactly.

    Still deliberately deferred to later pixel phases:
        - signed-difference extraction and table lookup from frame pixels;
        - native-subsampling traversal;
        - frame-buffer downSampleLuma traversal;
        - scene-change/reset decisions;
        - explicit previous-output frame processing;
        - VapourSynth frame access and getFrame integration.

    This module must not own or inspect cache slots, pins, checkpoints, hot zones,
    prune, recovery state, VapourSynth request lifecycle state, per-instance
    cache authority, diagnostics counters, or summary printers.
